# Onboarding Error

If you are seeing this page, it means that there was an error while onboarding. Please try again.

There are a few reasons why this could happen:

1. You may have uploaded an invalid save file. Please make sure that you are uploading a valid save file.
2. You may have uploaded a save file that is too large. Please make sure that your save file is less than 100MB.
3. If the save has less than 3 saves, it cannot process due to a bug. Please open your game and create more saves until you have 3 saves.

If you are still having issues, please contact us on our Discord server, which is linked in the footer.
