# Onboarding Error

If you are seeing this page, it means that there was an error while onboarding. Please try again.

There are a few reasons why this could happen:

1. You may have uploaded an invalid save file. Please make sure that you are uploading a valid save file. You may view our guide on how to export your save file [here](/help/upload).
2. Please check if the save file is not renamed. The file extension should be ".txt". Other formats will not be supported.
3. If the save has less than 3 saves, it cannot process due to a bug. Please open your game and create more saves until you have 3 saves. We are working on a fix for this, but do not expect it to be fixed soon as this only affects a small number of users.

If you are still having issues, please contact us on our Discord server, which is linked in the footer.
